#### Goals
Main goal of this repo is improve my skills in automation testing field. To do this I choose Cypress tool. 
I conducted functional test at Etsy website (www.etsy.com).   

Side goal is to learn the POM - Page Object Model. Knowing POM helps to create clearly and understandably tests script.
